# Technologies that were used

## UI / UX Design
- Special thanks to `Ibrahim Memon` for the awesome design on Figma. Check out his work here: [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1182197835889504018).

## Software technologies 

As usual I used `HTML` to build the basic structure of the project. <br>
I also used `CSS` to add UI/UX design to the project and made the site responsive to all screen sizes. <br>
I used a little bit of `JavaScript` to add interactivity especially in the `vector icon` part. <br>

## features 

🎞️ The design is full of transitions. <br>
📱 Responsive design for all screens. <br>
⚡ Fast loading and smooth user experience. <br>
🔗 Direct links to my work and accounts. <br>
